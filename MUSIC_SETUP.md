# Music Player Setup

To complete the music player setup, you need to add your 3 music files to the `public/music/` folder.

## Steps:

1. Create a folder called `music` inside the `public` folder
2. Download your 3 songs as MP3 files
3. Rename them to:
   - `khwab-ho-tum.mp3` - Khwab Ho Tum Ya Koi Haqiqat by Jagjit Singh
   - `1985.mp3` - 1985 by Bo Burnham
   - `i-want-it-that-way.mp3` - I Want It That Way by Backstreet Boys
4. Place all 3 files in `public/music/`

## File Structure:
```
public/
  music/
    khwab-ho-tum.mp3
    1985.mp3
    i-want-it-that-way.mp3
```

## Where to get MP3 files:
- Use YouTube to MP3 converters (like ytmp3.cc or y2mate.com)
- Or use Spotify downloaders (if you have premium)
- Make sure the files are good quality (320kbps recommended)

## Note:
The music player will show a floating button in the bottom-right corner. Clicking it opens the player with your playlist!
