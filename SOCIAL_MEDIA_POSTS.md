## 🚨 Response Templates (When They DM)

### **Interested but Unsure:**
```
Hi [Name]!

Thanks for reaching out! 

To see if we're a good fit, could you share:
1. What type of app? (food delivery, social, business, etc.)
2. Key features you need?
3. Timeline expectation?
4. Do you have designs or just an idea?

I respond within 24h and can hop on a quick call to discuss.

You can also check my work at togetha.me

Looking forward to hearing about your project!

Best,
Adesh
```

### **Price Negotiation:**
```
I appreciate your interest!

The ₹5-7K pricing is specifically for portfolio-building projects with these conditions:
- 2-4 week timeline (no rush)
- Permission to use as case study
- Detailed testimonial after completion
- Reasonable scope (MVP-level)

For larger projects or different terms, my standard rate is ₹15-25K depending on complexity.

The launch offer is genuine - I'm investing in building my portfolio right now.

Does that work for you?
```

### **Scope Creep:**
```
That's a great feature idea!

Based on what you've described, this goes beyond the ₹5-7K tier which covers:
- [List original scope]

What you're proposing is more aligned with a ₹12-15K project.

Options:
1. We start with MVP at ₹5-7K, add features later
2. We do full scope at adjusted pricing
3. I can recommend someone else if budget is fixed

What works best for you?
```

## ✅ RECOMMENDED: Post This on LinkedIn NOW

**Use Option 2 (Value-First)** - It has the best balance of:
- Attention-grabbing
- Trust-building
- Clear value
- Social proof

---

**Your portfolio is live. Your posts are ready. Time to get clients!** 🚀

Copy any of these, customize if needed, and post! 

Good luck! 💪
